        <h2>Taste Testers Wanted!</h2>
        <p>We strive to create ice cream that everyone can enjoy! We use all natural ingrediants in all of our soft serves!
          Additionally, we have recently released new flavors that are allergen friendly! We are currently experimenting with dairy
          free soft serve options, as well as a gluten free waffle cone option! If you are intersted in being a taste-tester please 
          reach out to us!

        <h2>Sprinkles and Our Mission!</h2>

        <p>One of our beloved cows is Sprinkles! She is our little mascot when we go into sourcing our dairy from farms that 
          value humane animal treatment. The Big Moo Creamery wants to help others to consider more of what is happenings before a product reaches the user.
          This is why we have so many places to learn about dairy farming and ethically sourcing products around our store!

        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>From the start, two best friends - Lindsey and Laney- (now co-founders of the Big Moo Creamery), 
          sought a way to bring artisan ice flavors into soft serve form!
          After being inspired by Laney's grandmother's homemade waffle cones they realized they could create 
          a company of their own. They seek to take ice cream back to its roots by incorporating 
          agricultural perspectives of dairy farming into an all natural and delicious dessert!
